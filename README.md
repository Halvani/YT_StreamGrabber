## YT_StreamGrabber
YT_StreamGrabber is a small tool, based on the dependency-free Python library <a href="https://github.com/pytube/pytube">pytube</a>), which allows to download arbitrary audio/video streams from YouTube in a convenient way. You can download individual streams or entire playlists, which is particularly useful for watching video lecture series offline.

## Usage
YT_StreamGrabber can be used in three ways:

- UI for easy use without insight into technical details 
- Python module, e.g. to extend existing applications 
- Jupyter notebook for to direct interaction 

I recommend the UI. For this, simply call it from the command line via: 
```
